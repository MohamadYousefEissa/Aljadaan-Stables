            lourished throughout _Monuments, archaeological sites, impregnable
            castles, citadels and the Dead Cities narrate the glorious history
            of ancient civilizations. It is a wonderful panorama of natural
            colors and images, seacoast, mountains, forests, rolling hills,
            fertile valleys, plains and steppes. The basaltic and limestone

            stand proud in many historical sites; khans scatter the Silk Road,
            castles tower from the medieval ages and mosques and palaces are
            witnesses of a rich history. Syria has always been a center where
            East and West. The tourist can el this exchange of civilizes through
            its art and the open-minded, warm, welcoming and ever smiling
            Syrians.

            role in the birth and the development of the Arabian horse.</br> The
            Syrian Desert is the homeland of Arabian horse lines which were
            related to names of individuals such as (Jedran, In zobeini, Ibn
            Aamoud, Ibn Sehian, In Sbeil, Ibn Khidli, Al Sahlan, Shrrak,
            Sabbah...) These individuals belonged to Arabian tribes that settled
            in the Syrian desert such as (Shammar, Rualla, Fidaan, Sbaa, Weld
            Ali, Tai, Al Jbour, Naem, Al Hadadeen, Al Mawali, Bani Khaled....)
            and we rarely find names of the main lines such as Seglawieh, Obaya,
            Maanagia, Koheila, Dahma, that are not attached to these names.</br> A
            quick look at the history books and stud records reveal that Syria
            with its ancient cities such as Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Deir
            Ezzour and Palmyra, was the destination for many travellers and
            searchers who came to obtain Arabian horses. Indeed the majority of
            the foundation stock of the world breeding programmes were of Syrian
            origin. After the national campaign of the Syrian Ministry of
            Agriculture, experts and enthusiasts encouraged by our late Basil
            Hafez.</br> Al Assad, started to register Arabian horses in Syria.
            Furthermore, Syria become a WAHO member. This was an essential step
            to restore Syria as one of the central countries in the world of the
            Arabian horses, as well as to assume its role as an important source
            of the noble breed of the Asil Arabians.

            Damascus was iberced by sinim Arabs in the year 636.</br> It was the
            capital of Umayyads whose legacy can be seen today in the Umayad
            Mosque built by Al Walid Bin Abd Al Malek.<br />
            Damascus is fed by the Barada river whose seven branches irrigate
            the city.</br> The city is surrounded by the magestic Qasioun mountain on
            one side and the fertile oasis (Alghotah) on the other.<br />
            The city is famed for its fragrant smell;</br> wherever you walk the
            smell of Jasmine, lemon and bitter orange scents the air. Damascus
            was also widely known for its markets, baths, mosques, schools,
            clean air, pure water, as well as its many ruins and historical
            remains.

            The Arabian horse is known for its beauty, strength, bravery and
            faithfulness. As such it was most desired by those who wanted to
            breed it purely, as well as to improve other horse breeds.<br />
            There are hardly any horse breeds in the world that do not trace
            their blood line to the Arabian horses.
            In this way, the Arabian horse has become a father and founder of
            many horse breeds in the world.<br />
            It deserves to be called the Arabian ambassador to the world. The
            Arabian horse has occupied high status in the Arabs' life.
            Islam elevated its position and encouraged its breeding.
            Moreover it was mentioned in the Holy Quran and in several speeches
            of Prophet Mohammad.<br />
            Ancient and contemporary Arab poets, artists and writers have
            considered the Arabian horse a rich subject stimulating artistic
            creation.
