          These Syrian Arabian Horses still maintain their physical and mental
          characteristics tracing their descent to the Arabian Tribes in the
          Sham desert.</br></br>  
           These tribes kept these horses during their long
          history and carried the name of their individuals and clans.</br></br>
           Our aim
          is to reinstate the purity of the Syrian Arabian Horse. This stems
          from our country's growing interest in its horses, their history and
          culture. After all those who brush tradition to one side, will have
          no part in the future development of Syria and the Arabian Horse.
